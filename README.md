- upinani remenu

- firmware [pocitadlo podle typu procesoru](http://calculator.josefprusa.cz/)
- firmware [sprinter](http://reprap.org/wiki/Sprinter) - nejlepe branch experimental (na githubu)

## software chain

* prevod z STL do GCODE
  - http://slic3r.org/
  - http://reprap.org/wiki/Skeinforge

* python na posilani gcode prikazu do tiskarny
  rovnou z command line

# building in progress

## printed parts gotchas

### couplings

some parts are [different](http://reprap.org/wiki/RP_alternatives) from official "stable" version

eg couplings are made by [@nophead](http://hydraraptor.blogspot.com/)
